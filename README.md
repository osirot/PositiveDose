# PositiveDose
app that sends positive texts to friends

This Android App was built using Android studios for a workshop event I attended with Woman Who Code. 
The app uses contacts in a users phone, the user chooses which contact to send, and the app deleivers a 
"Positive Dose" which is just a positive text message sent to a friend.
